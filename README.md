# chess_analysis

This is a hobby DS project for myself to better understand chess.

Chess is a strategic game where the goal of the game is to take down the opponent's King.

Because each player gets to move a single piece per turn, it is important to make meaningful moves rather than wasteful moves.

Although there are some guidelines that define what a good vs. bad move is, there are vast amounts of possible game states
in chess which make it difficult to figure out what move is best in a certain situation.

The goal of this project is to understand how different chess players play their game and what statistics are good estimators of win probability.

At a higher level, this project consists of

1. Data Collection
2. Data Processing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Extration / Engineering
5. Modelling the conditional expectation with different models.
